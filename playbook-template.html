  <li><strong>Lead with empathy & domain credibility:</strong> cite quick wins relevant to their system size (e.g., "For 20–40 vehicle agencies we cut no-shows X% with confirmation callbacks").</li>
  <li><strong>Use their data early:</strong> anonymized sample imports speed trust and reveal gaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert pain into measurable success criteria:</strong> tie each feature to a KPI you'll track in 30/60/90 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Address blockers proactively:</strong> security questionnaires, Section 15 compliance proof, and reference calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Timebox conversations:</strong> stakeholders are busy — present concise agendas and next steps after each meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables to Leave After Each Meeting</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One-page summary of what you learned, key decisions, and next steps (send within 24 hours).</li>
  <li>Demo/trial request or data template (if agreed).</li>
  <li>Stakeholder contact map and procurement timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like, I can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert this into a 3-month calendar with specific meeting templates and email follow-ups.</li>
  <li>Generate a one-page RFP response template mapped to the agency's prioritized requirements. Which do you prefer?</li>
</ul>

  - Regulatory/compliance drivers creating urgency

**Example**:

> "**Buying Triggers**: Agencies establishing in-house law enforcement operations require immediate technology procurement for:
>
> - Video management systems with AI-powered search capabilities
> - Evidence management platforms with chain-of-custody tracking
> - Incident reporting software linking driver/dispatcher reports
> - Real-time communication systems enabling investigators to coordinate
> - Mobile data terminals providing detectives with instant access to transit system data"

#### **B. Lookalike Prospects**

- **Definition**: Comparable agencies facing identical challenges (target account list)
- **What to include**:
  - Agency names with geographic location
  - Fleet size (comparable scale indicator)
  - Specific parallel challenges they face
  - Procurement timing signals if available

**Example**:

> "**Lookalike Prospects**: Major transit agencies with existing police forces but limited investigative capabilities: WMATA (Washington DC) 1,500+ vehicles, BART (San Francisco) 669 vehicles, LA Metro 2,300+ vehicles, SEPTA (Philadelphia) 2,200+ vehicles. All face similar crime response challenges and local PD coordination frustrations."

#### **C. Cross-Sell Opportunities**

- **Definition**: Adjacent technology procurements the agency will evaluate in same budget cycle
- **What to identify**:
  - Complementary systems that integrate with primary procurement
  - Technology categories solving related operational challenges
  - Implementation timing synergies (unified go-live dates)

**Example**:

> "**Cross-Sell Angle**: Agencies investing in safety technology infrastructure typically evaluate driver safety systems within same budget cycle. In-cab cameras with panic button integration, wheelchair securement monitoring, and automated incident detection complement investigative capabilities—providing evidence quality and response speed improvements detectives demand."
